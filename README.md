## 📊 Super Bowl Ads — Are They Effective?

This project explores the impact of Super Bowl advertising using real marketing analytics techniques. The Super Bowl is known for its record-breaking ad costs and massive viewership — but does all that spending actually work?

In this notebook, I break down the data, analyze performance metrics, and uncover what makes certain ads more memorable and engaging than others.

🔍 Project Overview

Companies spend millions for just 30 seconds of airtime during the Super Bowl. The goal of this project is to understand whether those investments translate into measurable outcomes, such as:

Higher viewership engagement

Increased YouTube popularity

Emotional responses

Brand recall and sentiment

Using several datasets, I explore how creative choices (humor, celebrity appearances, emotional storytelling, etc.) influence how successful an ad becomes.
